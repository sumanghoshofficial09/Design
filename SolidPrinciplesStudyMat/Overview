this course will give you fundamental concept of solid principle :
knowing solid principles is must have set for any software developer 
this will be use to create robust software and elegant software

like if you say about open closed principals : 

closed for modification
--------------------------------------------
new features getting added to the software should not have to modify existing code 


open for extension : 
-----------------------------------------------

software component should be extendable to add a new feature or to add a new behavior to it 

it concept will be explained with the help of real world analogy 



first we analyze real world example  and then we analyze code snippet ; 


we will learn how to identify the badly designed code and also how to apply solid principles to fix it or you can redesign the code

we wil code using live ide
