it states that
Every software component should have only one responsibility


when we say software component , in object oriented programming principle , the first concept come to use is class

software component can be also referred to a method / function or module

rule state that software component should have only one responsibility

example of swiss army knife : 

it is a combination of number of useful tools each one individual responsibility  

each one with distinct purpose
you think swiss army knife as software component , it violates the single responsibility principle 

why?  because it has multiple responsibilities 
what is the recommendation no srp ?

normal kitchen knife has a single responsibility
it can be  only be used for cutting purpose , you cannot use it as can opener nor as screw driver
