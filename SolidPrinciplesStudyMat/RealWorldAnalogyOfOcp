lets take the example of WII console

we can some extra feature to the WII console 

we can add the zapper feature or we can add the steering wheel feature to the  

WII console , but we donot have to perform any visible changes to basic WII console 

it was just plug and play , think about a situation

when WII console came out of factory , it came out as closed for modification

Cause WII dont want their customers to go and open the console on their own,

but they still made it possible for their customers to add accessories

so there by add extensions or new feature to the wii console 

this did not happen by accident , this happened becuase engineer in wii wanted theird

product to behave like this 

in summary WII console is designed in such a way such that it is closed for modification a
and open for extension

But when say a software component is closed for modification and open for 

extension then what do we mean

close for modification :
----------------------------

means new features getting added to software component  , does not means that we have to 
modify existing code , of the existing application 

open for extension 
-------------------

A software component should be open for extension
