Every software component should have only one reason to change 

this is the term uncle robert bob define in book to define SRP 


Heraclitus : - the only thing in constant is change 


Change is inevitable 

Software is never dormant , it always keep changing 


there could be multiple reason for software company to change in future 

lets jotted down some reason to change for Student class 
that will possibly come in future 

Reason for change : 

-----------------------

Change in the student id format as suggested by school mangement 


Change in student name format as suggested by jurisdiction

changes in backend database 

what does Single Responsibility Principle say : 

====================================================

every software component should have only and only one reason to change 

if a class has multiple reason to change then the frequncy of changing will increase 

if change to a software component opens up a possibility in introducing the bugs 
more changes in software component , more possibility in introducing software bugs


this needs more rigorous testing to make sure we are catching all the bugs
 
 
 difference between following A SRP and not following SRP , could be considerable financial impact 
 
 it will reduce the software maintanence cost in the long run 
 
 
 if the reason to changes are related closely we can combine each other
